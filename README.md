### From Reddit: [Challenge #363 [Easy] I before E except after C](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/8q96da/20180611_challenge_363_easy_i_before_e_except/)
# Background

"I before E except after C" is perhaps the most famous English spelling rule. For the purpose of this challenge, the rule says:

* if "ei" appears in a word, it must immediately follow "c".
* If "ie" appears in a word, it must not immediately follow "c".

A word also follows the rule if neither "ei" nor "ie" appears anywhere in the word. Examples of words that follow this rule are:

    fiery hierarchy hieroglyphic ceiling inconceivable receipt daily programmer one two three 

There are many exceptions that don't follow this rule, such as:

# Challenge
